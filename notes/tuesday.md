# Tuesday Notes
another change
another change to Tuesday Notes

# Some notes:
## ls -l
l is a flag, it stands for long
instead of showing just a list of directories and files, it shows info like permission settings, size of the resource, who owns it, â€¦

## ls -a
shows all of the hidden files

## ls -la shows us all of the hidden files, with the long format
